# Core tenets of Security, Privacy, Compliance (Trust Center, DPA, OST, and more)

This episode will give you ability to descibe the purpose of following

- Documents & Websites
  - Microsoft Privacy Statement,
  - Online Services Terms (OST),
  - Data Protection Addendum (DPA) (Amendment)
  - Trust Center
  - Azure compliance documentation
- Azure Sovereign Regions
  - Azure Governmant cloud services and
  - Azure China cloud services

but additionally you need to be able to describe what are Azure Sovereign region, what they were created for, with 2 main ones called - Azure Government and Azure China.

# Microsoft Privacy Statement

I must say that when I learn about the documents and privacies and policies and different things like that, that are not very technical It is very easy to get lost because of that I will try to put every single document and website that we will learn about today into 3 main categories. I will explain what kind of information do they provide, for which services and for what kind of audience where they are designed for. This hopefully will allow you not only to better understand a specific topic that we are talking about but also make it easier to make a distinction between them.

And with Microsoft Privacy Statement let's start with the INFO. So what kind of information you can find in that document. This document talks about the personal data - the collection of that data , the purpose of that collection but also the usage across different services and it describes this information in the context of following Microsoft offereings.

- All of the services,
- Application
- Websites
- Software
- Servers
- Devices

So if you have anything from Microsoft that you can pretty much imagine like windows, maybe you use Azure, maybe you have a Surface phone, xbox or simply an office. All those services interact with your personal data and Microsoft Privacy Statement will describe what kind of information is collected for each one of those services, for what purposes and how it's being used. Because of the nature of that document - it is really designed for everyone so it doesn't matter if you are an enterprise customer or a private person. You can use Microsoft Privacy Statement to learn more about the usage of your personal data.

# Online Services Terms

![pic220](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic220.jpg)

The next document that we will cover is called - Online Services Terms. This document provides us with following information. It describes the legal agreement so-called Licensing Terms. Previously this was also called - Usage Rights. And this Legal agreement describes these usage rights in context of

- Online services of Microsoft so things like Azure, Dynamics 365, office 365 or any other offering from Microsoft 365 platform or maybe something simpler like Bing maps. All of those services are categorized under - Online Services. And those Licensing Terms simply explain to you as a customer what you are allowed and what you are disallowed to do when using those online services. Because this is a legal document, this is designed for your organizational legal teams. They can review and see if the applications and the services that you provide follow those legal agreements.

# Data Protection Addendum

![pic221](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic221.jpg)

our next document is called - Data Protection Addendum. This document covers the information about the obligations between your company and Microsoft. And those obligations are specifically mentioned around the processing and security of your personal but also your customer data. And because this document is an appendix to Online Services Terms it talks about those obligations in the context of the online services that you purchase from Microsoft. It is a very good document which was designed for both, your legal teams and security teams to review. So while it is similar to online Services Terms, This one focuses on the data and security of that data when using those Online Services.

# Trust Center

![pic222](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic222.jpg)

But besides the documents themselves you also have something called - Trust Center. In this case Trust Center first of all it is a website so it is called - One Stop Shop , a single place for your company. To review all of the information regarding:

- Security
- Compliance
- Privacy
- Policies
- Practices

around Microsoft services. And this provides the information again for all of Online Services of Microsoft. This website is pretty great for anyone in your organization because it starts at very high level but as you move through it will go deeper in detail into each specific topic. And it will provide you with a lot of information, helpful links, tools, checklists and plenty of Online Resources that you can check to learn about each specific topic. Because of the nature and the structure of the website it is really designed for anyone in your organization who really cares about either security, compliance or privacy. People like business managers, administrators, security teams and legal teams.

Let's navigate to Trust center. this is the portal that you will see first time when you open the page. key section of this page can be found at the very top - here you have Security, Privacy , Compliance. those are the main sections that you might be interested in (see pic below)

![pic223](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic223.jpg)

Let's imagene a scenarion where i am building an application right now, my application will be hosted and served to customers within european union. Because of that I want to know if my application will be GDPR compliant and if it won't what do I need to do to become GDPR. Therefore what you can do is go to Compliance offerings. (see pic below)

![pic224](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic224.jpg)

Amd in this page you can find different compliance for different Microsoft like Microsoft 365, Azure and other Microdsoft services. Those compliance offerings are spread into multiple categories -> some that are Global, some are specific to US Government and some others that are industry specific or even regional. (see pic below)

![pic225](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic225.jpg)

And if you scroll down you will be able to find separate section - Compliance offerings that are made specifically for Azure. In this case we want to know if our application will be GDPR compliant. Therefore I will select - Regional and go to GDPR (EU) (see pic below)

![pic226](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic226.jpg)

And once selected I will be navigated to another documentation page. What I like about this documentation is that it doesn't assume that I know every single thing about this regulation. Therefore it typically starts with an overview. In this case I can very quickly find that GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation (see pic below)

![pic227](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic227.jpg)

Then I will be able to read what is there, get some helpful links. Then documentation will talk about the key terminology and go into more details as we move along. On the left hand side menu you will find a lot of additional sections related to GDPR, which will explain the key topics regarding these regulations and will help you stay compliant with them. For example in Data subject requests you can find different Microsoft products (see pic below)

![pic228](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic228.jpg)

Products like Azure and once selected this document not only explains what Azure Data Subject Requests are but also how Azure and default components within Azure help you fulfill those requests in order to stay compliant with GDPR requirements.

# Azure Compliance Documentation

![pic229](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic229.jpg)

And besides Trust Center we have another portal called Azure Compliance Docs. This portal provides us with information regarding compliance as the name suggests, having the same categories that we have just seen in the Trust Center, spliting those compliance offerings into multiple categories as we just seen in a Trust Center like - National, US Government, Industry specific or Regional and many more.

You might think how is that different from the Trust Center that we have just talked about. Because we have seen that there was Azure mentioned there on the list as well.

The difference here is very minimal, first of all this portal is dedicated to Aure. So the offer that describes is only in the context of Azure Platform and also it doesn't talk about anything else besides compliance. You will not find the topics of Security and Privacy here. It is mostly the compliance offering in the context of Azure as such this is pretty much the same audience as the previous one. So it is designed for your business managers, administrators, security teams and legal teams. If you have a team that works specifically with Azure this might be the better place for them to start their journey and start exploring compliance offerings for Azure.

If you use multiple cloud services of Microsoft then the trust Center might be better place for you to start.

Now we know the key documents and key websites when it comes to security, privacy and compliance we can move to another topic which are Azure Sovereign Regions

# Azure Sovereign Regions

![pic230](https://github.com/Julian22222/Clouds/blob/main/Azure/IMG/pic230.jpg)

In previous episodes we have talked about how there are plenty of regions spread across the globe when it comes to Azure and those are called - Public Cloud Regions. They are accessible from anywhere in the world and any customer can choose which region they want to use. (blue dots on the pic above)

But besides those regions there are some specific regions of Azure called- Sovereign Regions. On the planet there are specific markets with specific compliance and security requirements. And in order to meet those requirements and provide Azure services, Microsoft decided to create special regions and those are - Sovereign Regions.

The first one that we will talk about is:

- Azure Government (green dots on the pic above)

This isn't any government, it is actually for US government. That means in United States there are multiple regions specifically designed for Azure government security and compliance requirements. For example we have - US government Arizona, US government Texas, US DOD Central, US DOD East. DOD- stands for Department Of Defense. So as you can imagine those are highly regulated environment.

In order to provide the space for US government to build applications in the cloud Azure government is a separate instance of Azure. There is even a separate portal where you access Azure government but besides the separate instance all of the services follow separate life cycle. And because of that separate life cycle if you design any application for a Sovereign Region of Azure make sure to first check if the service that you want to use is already available there. Because eventually most of the services will get to the Sovereign Regions they get there a little bit later because of the separate life cycle and additional security requirements that they need to check. And besides separate instance of the services themselves Azure government regions are physically isolated from each other. Because this is highly regulated environment only authorized and scanned personnel can access those services and infrastructure which is very important when it comes to the security requirements for those regions.

And all across the globe similar things happens in China. Another Sovereign Region is Azure China.

- Azure China (red dots on the pic above)

Because chinese market is a very specific market but also highly regulated one and one of the most important regulation that requires a separate region of Azure in China. Is that in order for any company to run cloud services inside of China you need to be a telecom which is registered in China with less than 50 % foreign interest. Because Microsoft is a global company there is no way for them to meet this requirement therefore this region is a little bit different than the others. it is still separate instance so therefore separate portal, separate life cycle for the products and it is also physically separated just like Azure Government but one unique thing about Azure China Region is that it is operated by a different company as we said Microsoft can't operate it because of that regulation. Therefore it is operated by a Chinese company called - 21 VIANET. And this is the key distinction here so Microsoft is not physically running services in China.

Well not entirely, one thing that I want to mention here is that there is one region called - East Asia, which is part of the public cloud. Although that region is running in Hong Kong. And while Hong Kong is still part of China it is - One Contry Two Governments Type Of Rule. Therefore East Asia while it is in China - it is part of the public cloud. But China North and China East are part of the mainland China. Therefore they are part of the Sovereign Region of Azure China.

Azure Sovereign Regions in short - those are specific regions of Azure that were created to meet high security and compliance requirements for specific markets.

# Summary

Key Characteristics

- Microsoft Privacy Statement - document that explains collection, purpose and usage of your personal data for all Microsoft offerings. From physical devices and servers, through applications and services

- Online Service Terms (OST) - license terms (use rights) for Microsoft online products and services

If you purchase online services from Microsoft through volume licensing like Azure, Office 365 and many others. Online Services terms will describe the licensing terms called - usage rights for those products. So in this document you will be able to find the information - what can you do and what you can't do with those services. And when you read through Online Services Terms you will find appendix called - Data Protection Addendum (DPA).

- Data Protection Addendum (DPA) - in-depth specification on processing and security of personal and customer data as well as obligations of the customer and Microsoft.

This document provides in-depth specification when it comes to obligations of the customer and Microsoft in terms of processing and security of personal and customer data.

- Trust Center - single place for organizations to review security, privacy and compliance of Microsoft online services.

This is one-stop shop - which is a single place for the organization to review Security, Privacy, Compliance and some extra additional topics when it comes to online services. If you don't know where to begin your journey this would be the great place to start.

- Azure Compliance Documentation - compliance documentation for Azure services

And if you build solutions specifically for Azure and you want to be sure that you will stay compliant - Azure Compliance Documentation portal will have all of this information for you in a single place.

- Azure Sovereign Regions provide Azure services in markets with very strict regulatory requirements.

it is specific regions of Azure that were designed to meet very strict requirements of specific markets across the globe

    - Azure Government ( designed for US government)
    - Azure China (designed for Chinese market)
