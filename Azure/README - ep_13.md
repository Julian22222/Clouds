# Azure Marketplace

It is very similar to online shop. As in online shops you can select your products that you need, add them to your basket and simply hit purchase. You can also search for the products that you need.
Similar to this example inside of Azure marketplace you search for services and there are templates for those services provided by Microsoft and other vendors. A single template can provide one or multiple services.
So from your perspective Azure marketplace is simply Azure shop where you purchase Azure services or out of the box solutions that take advantage of Azure services. Inside of the Azure marketplace you can find products created by both Microsoft but also third-party vendors. If your company builds a solution that based on Azure services or very well integrates with them you can build your own templates and publish them to Azure marketplace. So your customers can not only find you but very easily purchase services with a simple click of a button.

The products that you will find within Azure marketplace might consist of services in all 3 categories. They might take advantage of Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS) but also Software as a service (SaaS).

Purchasing products in Azure marketplace is very simple, you can do it through one of multiple ways.

1. In Azure Portal - From left top corner, press menu btn --> + Create resorce
2. Access resources from the top Search line in Azure Portal
3. Use --> https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/ website, it is the same as Azure Portal, it only has a different interface for customers to use.

Key Characteristics:

- "Azure shop"
- First and third-party products
- IaaS, PaaS and SaaS

Great about Azure marketplace is that it has baked in billing -> that means if you purchase services through Azure Portal marketplace and if there is a license cost for some service. That license cost will be automatically charged to your Azure account and you will be automatically billed through Microsoft billing platform. It is really great because you don't need to go to any external website to purchase licenses if those are needed.

Azure marketplace is part of something bigger, a bigger thing is called Commercial Marketplace. Apparently there are 2 commercial marketplaces. One is called - Microsoft Appsource and second is called - Azure marketplace.
Inside of the Microsoft APPSOURCE you have products available for multiple microsoft platforms,like:

- Azure,
- Power BI,
- DYNAMIC 365 platform
- Microsoft 365 platform

Whereas in Azure marketplace you will find products available for Azure. But besides the product availability the other major difference is the users that those portals are targeting.
-For Azure marketplace the key target the users that should be using this portal are developers and IT professionals who are building their solutions based on Azure services.
-Whereas for Microsoft APPSOURCE the target are business users.
