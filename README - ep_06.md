# Cloud Deployment Models - Public, hybrid and private Cloud

## Public Cloud (pic 18)

Key Characteristics:

- Everything runs on cloud provider hardware
- No local hardware
- Some services share hardware with other customers

In order to understand the public cloud we need to make a very clear separation of where we are deploying our services. We are either deploying them to the cloud service provider or inside of our own datacenter (On-Premises Environment).

When it comes to the public cloud that means all our resources are hosted in the public cloud. That means we don't own our own Hardware anywhere. In public Cloud some services share the hardware with other customers this usually is solved by picking the right pricing tier. You should be aware of that when you starting with the cloud and you have some security compliance policies in place.

The public cloud is very simple to understand in general, you are hosting everything in public cloud, as in any deployment model there are always advantages and disadvantages.(pic 19)

In this case when it comes to advantages there is no CapEx (No Capital Expenditure),that means no big initial investment on your side. With cloud being highly available and agile be default to get those all advantages by just simply going to the cloud. Thanks to pay-as-you-go pricing and this consumtion model that we are talking about, you only pay for resources that you use and because Microsoft manages all of the hardware there is no hardware maintenance required and no deep technical skills required from your teams.

But there are some Disadvantages, there is one major one when it comes to security in compliance as well cloud is secure by default there may be specific security requirements or government policies, industry standards or legal requirements the public clouds can't meet. In that case the public cloud might not be the right choice for you. There is always an issue with ownership, because if you want to maintain your own hardware or make changes to the hardware then again you can't do that because Microsoft is hosting all the hardware and managing all the hardware in their own data centers and if you have some specific unique business requirements, public cloud might not be the one for you.

On the other hand we have private cloud (On-Premises), which is reverse model (pic 20). You don't have anything in public cloud, you host everything in your own Datacenter. Remember here you need to provide self service in order to be able to consider cloud and you need to provide all the benefits of the cloud except in your own Datacenter. In this scenario you are the one who maintaining all the hardware.

So let's talk about advantages and disadvantages of using private cloud (pic 21).
Advantages:

- because you maintain everything you have all the possibilities, so you can support pretty much any scenario. You have total control over security and you can meet any security and compliant requirements but maintaining your own hardware comes at a cost and that cost is a big initial (CapEx) capital expenditure investment that you need to make. There is a limited agility because that agility is limited by the amount of hardware and skills of your team. Excellent skills and expertise of your internal team is pretty much mandatory when running private cloud. And these comes at a cost which brings us to the third model --> Hybrid Cloud model.

Hybrid Cloud model. (pic 22) In this model you take advantage of both -> Public and Private cloud. You connect them together to provide the greatest flexibility out of those 3 options.

When talking about advantages and disadvantages the obvious one is the great flexibility. (pic 23). But beyond that you can run applications in private Cloud, utilize existing infrastructure, meet any security requirements but everything else move to the cloud and take advantage of all the good stuff from the cloud.
In this case Disadvantages are pretty obvious --> bigger environment, consisting fro both pablic and private cloud might be more expensive but it definitely more complicated to manage an as such puts a bigger strain and bigger requirement on the skills and expertise of your internal IT teams.
