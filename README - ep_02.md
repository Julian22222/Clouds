# Principle of economies of scale

- If you have small cloud resorces your price per customer will be quite high
- If you have medium cloud resorces your price per customer will be better but still at quite medium range
- If you have large cloud resources your price per customer will be quite low and very competative onthe market

As Cloud grouws and it has more customers the price of their services will go down, because big companies like Microsoft will get more efficient at what they do.
Will be more efficient on building new Data centres, getting better prices for the hardware
