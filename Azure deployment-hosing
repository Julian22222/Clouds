Microsoft Azure

Subscriptions (Azure subscription) // all Projects can go under one subscription (--> Azure subscription 1, in our case)
What package you use and how mach you pay for using Azure services
Resource group (Create new Resource Group for each project)
works as a bag where we put all used, needed services for our app in 1 Resource group. (App Services, SQL databases,SQL server,Key Vault, Log Analytics workspace, App Service Plan) <-- all of them must be in the same Resource group for particular applicatiopn
App Services
allow you build and deploy/host your app (web apps, mobile back end and RESTful APIs without managing infrastructure).
It offers auto-scaling and high availability, supports both Windows and Linux
When creating new app services --> create Web App ( Not a Web App + Database)
SQL server
allow to create Server name, Server user ID (In Azure Portal --> Server admin login) and Server Password
SQL databases
allow to get the connection string to DB
Key Vault How to use Key Vault for your secrets
Creates KeyVaultURL <--copy - paste it to - to use in appsettings.json and in Program.cs for Our secrets /// (Vault URL <- in Key Vault)

KeyVault Client Secret value expires after some time --> will not connect to your Database , Need to Renew Client Secret for KeyVault in Microsoft Azure/ to Update --> Azure/App registrations/All applications --> choose your project name --> Certificates & secrets --> Create new Client Secret value here

Located in Azure cloud, this is Azure service where we can store Secrets
